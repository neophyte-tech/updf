Ultimate PDF Converter v2
=========================

Published on Google Play Store as https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.neoandroid.updfv2

* Introduction
A complete rewrite of the original Ultimate PDF Converter APP. The web services haven't been modified much though.

* Some exciting new features:
1. Includes File Pick as well as the original 'Send'/'Share' method
2. Queue multiple files for conversion - no more waiting!
3. Choose where to save the converted file

* Dependencies
This depends on the neoXMLParser and neoFilePicker library projects

* TODO
1. Fix landscape view and enable it in the app - currently the app forces portrait mode
2. Translations - we need multilanguage support!
3. Testing and bug fixing for multiple android devices.
